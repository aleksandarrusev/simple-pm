## Simple PM

This is just a proof of concept of the project management system I'm building for my Master thesis. Currently, the Scrum 
functionality is implemented and Kanban is still in development.

##### In the current phase, the app has the following features:
- Create and update projects
- Choose between Kanban and Scrum
- Create and update sprints
- Create columns for the board of each sprint
- Create and update tasks
- Board that displays all the tasks and allows moving tasks between different columns
- Sprint and project backlog

##### Demo

##### Upcomming features:
- Add board for the Kanban projects
- Improve user roles and limit some of the functionalities only for specific roles/users
- Allow deleting of projects/sprints and tasks
- Improve visual design by adding more modals, as in Jira
